# ls-win-core-affinity
set process core affinity in windows by powershell

Thanks to intel, when you trigger your build tasks then switch to watch videos, all the tasks are then scheduled on efficient cores. The only good thing is it doubles your video time.

This tool is to kill the rubbish time after trigger long time build task.

## Feature
1. set affinity to performance cores
2. set realtime to get most cpu time
3. install as a service and start on boot
